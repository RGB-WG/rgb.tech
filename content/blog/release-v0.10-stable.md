It's been 5 month since the first alpha of [RGB v0.10] - and today we are
thrilled to make the stable release of the RGB command-line tool and runtime 
library for desktop and mobile integration.

The library was extensively tested by several independent teams and powers
three different wallets ([MyCitadel] on Desktop, [Iris] on Android, [BitMask] in
Web); it also has stable results on end-to-end tests, including performing
multiple complex transfers of multiple assets. Finally, wallet developers may
use [BDK integration](https://github.com/RGB-Tools/) developed by Bitfinex team. 

You can read more about RGB v0.10 functionality in our [previous announcement][RGB v0.10].
