If you are developer looking for creating new forms of RGB smart contracts or
integrate RGB into your software, check out developer guidelines:

* ### Writing contracts

  Simple RGB contracts can be created in **Rust** (using handy macros). 
  More advanced contracts will require writing code for **AluVM** in
  **AluAssemblye** language. We also work on a new high-level language called
  **Contractum**, with its first version release targeting end of the year.

* ### Integrating RGB

  Want to let your users access RGB assets & smart contracts?
  Integrating RGB is simple as using one of existing SDKs in your project and
  working with JSON data structures. Check what libraries exists for RGB
  integration today, provided by several independent teams and companies.

* ### Learn RGB

  RGB is much more complex than simple bitcoin applications; to unlock its true
  power in creating the world of Bitcoin Finance (#BiFi) it is important
  to understand its terminology and internal architecture in details. A good
  starting point can be through multiple RGB learning resources.
