If you are developer looking for creating new forms of RGB smart contracts or
integrate RGB into your software, check out developer guidelines:

* ### Writing contracts

  Simple RGB contracts can be created in **Rust** (using handy macros). 
  More advanced contracts will require writing code for **AluVM** in
  **AluAssemblye** language. We also work on a new high-level language called
  **Contractum**, with its first version release targeting end of the year.
