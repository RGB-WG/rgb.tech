Wallet libraries provide functionality such as constructing and processing RGB
invoices, working with PSBT files containing RGB or other client-side-validated
commitments, analyzing bitcoin and tapret wallet descriptors. While a reference
implementation of RGB wallet library is provided by 
[LNP/BP Standards Association](LNP/BP) written in Rust, other implementations 
may be used, based on different bitcoin wallet solutions (like BDK) or done
in other languages.
