[**Dr Maxim Orlovsky**][dr-orlovsky] at [LNP/BP Standards Association][LNP/BP],
Switzerland. It has originated from an earlier prototypes and ideas on "colored
coins on Lightning" by **Giacomo Zucco** (BHB Network) and **Peter Todd**, who
proposed concepts of client-side-validation and single-use-seals. A lot of
