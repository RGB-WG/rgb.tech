RGB wallets are developed by the community and independent vendors. Please keep
in mind that there is no "official" RGB GUI wallet.

**NB: All existing wallets are not yet updated to the latest RGB protocol
version v0.10 and are not compatible with modern RGB contracts. If you are
interested in trying the new RGB v0.10 features please use the [command-line tool].**
