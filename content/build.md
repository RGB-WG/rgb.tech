RGB was designed to allow everything what is possible with blockchain-based 
smart contracts (like in Ethereum and other systems) &ndash; but in the scalable,
robust and private way. With RGB, you can do the following categories of smart
contracts (and much more):

* ### Tokens

  From stablecoins and corporate shares to securities and application-specific tokens.

* ### NFTs

  Issue digital media (books, music, video, podcasts) and collectible items.

* ### DeFi

  Do a liquidity pool, AMM-based DEX, or a collateral-based algorithmic stable-coin.

* ### DAOs

  Run a decentralized autonomous organization with all required functionality.
