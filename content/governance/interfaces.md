Contract interfaces define an API between smart contracts and software (wallets,
exchanges), allowing semantic-aware user interaction with arbitrary contracts.

[LNP/BP Standards Association](LNP/BP) maintains [standards](LNPBPs) and the 
registry for most-common used interfaces, named RGB-20, 21, 22 etc., however
for independent vendors it is optional whether they'd like to standardize 
custom interfaces. Standardization of interfaces doesn't affect wallet 
compatibility; RGB standard libraries provide a way to work with any interfaces,
even non-standard ones.
