RGB wallets are developed by community and independent vendors. Please keep
in mind that there is no "official" RGB GUI wallet.

**NB: All existing wallets were not yet updated to the latest RGB protocol
version v0.11 and are not compatible with the modern RGB contracts. If you are
interested in trying the new RGB v0.11 features please use [command-line tool].**
