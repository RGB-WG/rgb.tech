            </header>

            <p>RGB is a full-fledged smart contract system which operates on top of Bitcoin
and Lightning network. If you think about blockchain as a settlement layer and
Lightning as a scaling layer, <em>RGB is the programmability layer</em>, finally
adding to the first and most censorship-resistant cryptographic-based store of
value properties which were absent and desired for many years.</p>
<p>RGB achieves this through a separation of abstraction layers: the bitcoin
blockchain (layer 1) becomes a cryptographic commitment layer, which holds
<em>no data</em> but compact commitments to the smart contract state, which is
kept off-chain. These commitments do not occupy block space, since they
are kept inside taproot tree and not directly visible on-chain.</p>
<p>Such approach also allows RGB to operate on top of the Lightning network, since
it can work with any bitcoin transaction, including transactions incorporated
into a channel. RGB scripts and state fully exist in the client-side world, are
not seen from the outside (hence privacy) - and are not required to be validated by
anyone other than the contract participants (hence scalability).</p>
<p>RGB allows Bitcoin to pass beyond the limitations of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/cia-triad">CIA triad</a> (confidentiality,
integrity, and availability) by achieving different properties on different layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blockchain</strong> provides integrity &amp; availability;</li>
<li><strong>Lightning network</strong> – integrity &amp; confidentiality;</li>
<li><strong>RGB</strong> – confidentiality &amp; availability.</li>
</ul>

                </header>

                <p>Contract business logic in RGB is defined through so-called <em>schema</em>; the
specific RGB contract must implement some <em>schema</em>. One may think of a schema
as a "class" definition in the OOP world; in that terms, specific RGB contracts
are "class instances" created by the schema constructor (<em>genesis operation</em>).
Such approach allows to separate role of contract developer (in RGB called
<em>schema developer</em>) and <em>contract issuer</em>: the first one needs to be an
experienced developer, while the second one is not required to know anything
about coding or security at all. This also promotes re-use of common codebase by
different issuers for the same typical use cases (like fungible assets),
reducing the risk of mistakes.</p>
<p>RGB uses specially-designed virtual machine <a href="https://www.aluvm.org/">AluVM</a>, which is Turing-complete in
the same terms as EVM and WASM-based smart contracts (i.e. nearly computational
universal, but is bound by number of operation steps, measured by gas
consumption in Ethereum-like systems, and by accumulated computational
complexity measure in case of AluVM).</p>

                <p>In RGB, there is no such thing as "program a smart contract"; instead, contracts
themselves are issued with no code. This helps to simplify the life of asset
issuers and normies, who just need to issue a token, create their self-sovereign
identity, run a DAO etc.</p>
<p>This is achieved through separation of concerns, where the development work is
kept outside contracts, thanks to things called <strong>schema</strong> and <strong>interface</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="contract">Contract</h3>
<p>The contract is a contract genesis plus a history of operations on the
contract. Together they are used by RGB to compute a deterministic contract
state. To create a contract means to issue a contract genesis, which
requires no code at all. The Contract issuer just needs to pick a <strong>schema</strong>
which has all features needed in a contract – and use it during the
issuance. If the schema with the required properties doesn't exist, the issuer
can hire a developer to implement such a schema.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="schema">Schema</h3>
<p>If you think in terms of object-oriented programming (OOP), a contract is
an <em>instance</em> of some <em>class</em>, and in RGB terms this <em>class</em> is named
<strong>schema</strong>. Schema contains all the contract business logic, scripts,
definitions of state types (owned and global), allowed operations, rules
for validation, data type system etc. Schema by its nature is declarative,
it can be easily read or written with Rust macros, YAML, TOML and other
declarative languages. Once created, a schema may be used by many contracts
of the same type.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>
<p>An interface defines how a user-facing software (wallets etc) can
interact with a contract. Interfaces provide <strong>semantic</strong> information about
the contract and defines how its state can be presented to the user.
If one can compare schema to a <em>class</em> in OOP, than <strong>contract interface</strong>
should be compared to Java <em>interface</em> or Rust <em>trait</em>. As classes can
implement interfaces in Java, or structs can implement traits in Rust,
in RGB schema can implement many interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>

                <p>Today, there are two main ways for programming RGB smart contracts: using
rust-based RGB domain-specific language and with a specially-designed functional
smart contract language named <strong>Contractum</strong>. Unlike many other blockchain-based
smart contract systems, RGB also allows to create contracts without writing any
code at all – even for complex contracts like NFTs, identities, DAOs etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="zero-code-contracts">Zero-code contracts</h3>
<p>Because of the use of contract schemata, most of RGB contract types can be
issued without writing even a line of code. All you need is to find a schema
and use command-line tools or GUI-based wallets to issue your contract.</p>
<p><a href="/power-user/#issue" class="button button-secondary">Issue a contract with no code</a></p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="rgb-rust-dsl">RGB Rust DSL</h3>
<p>The simplest way of creating a new RGB schema or interface is to use Rust.
You can directly compile arbitrary rust data to be part of RGB contract state,
and you use macro-based DSL to define new schemata and interfaces. You can
export contracts, schema or interface into a binary form – or save them as
Base65-armored text for further distribution.</p>

</li>
<li><h3 id="contractum">Contractum</h3>
<p>Contractum is the forthcoming declarative language for writing safe and
easy-to-audit smart contracts for RGB. Contractum is being under an active
development and we plan to have it released by the end of the year. Today
you may preview how writing RGB contracts in Contractum may look like in a
future.</p>
